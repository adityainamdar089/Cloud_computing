# I. INTRODUCTION

The global health and fitness industry has witnessed exponential growth, with an increasing emphasis on personalized wellness solutions driven by technological advancements [1]. As sedentary lifestyles become more prevalent and individuals seek convenient, tailored fitness guidance, traditional one-size-fits-all workout applications have proven inadequate in addressing diverse user needs, preferences, and physiological constraints [2]. The advent of large language models (LLMs) has opened new avenues for generating contextually aware, personalized content across various domains, including healthcare and fitness [3]. However, effectively integrating LLM capabilities into production-ready fitness applications while ensuring structured output, scalability, and user privacy remains a significant challenge.

Existing fitness tracking applications typically rely on predefined workout templates or rule-based recommendation systems that lack the flexibility to adapt to individual user profiles dynamically [4]. While some platforms incorporate machine learning techniques for personalization, they often require extensive training datasets and fail to provide comprehensive, contextually relevant exercise and nutrition plans [5]. Moreover, the computational requirements for running sophisticated AI models locally on client devices present scalability and performance limitations, necessitating cloud-based inference architectures [6].

This paper presents FitnessTrack, a cloud-based fitness tracking platform that addresses these limitations by leveraging Google's Gemini large language model to generate personalized workout and nutrition plans tailored to individual user characteristics. The system employs a hybrid architecture combining a React-based frontend with a serverless Node.js/Express backend deployed on AWS Lambda, enabling automatic scaling while maintaining cost-effectiveness. The core innovation lies in the integration of sophisticated prompt engineering techniques with intelligent text parsing algorithms that extract structured exercise data from AI-generated responses, ensuring renderable and consistent workout plans.

The primary contributions of this work are threefold: (1) a novel approach to generating structured fitness plans using LLMs through carefully engineered prompts that enforce consistent formatting, (2) an intelligent parsing and normalization system that reliably extracts structured data from natural language responses using regex-based pattern matching, and (3) a scalable serverless architecture that demonstrates the feasibility of deploying production-ready AI-powered fitness applications on cloud infrastructure with automatic scaling capabilities.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section II reviews related work in fitness applications and LLM integration. Section III presents the system architecture and design principles. Section IV details the implementation of key components, including prompt engineering, parsing algorithms, and cloud infrastructure. Section V discusses the system's capabilities and preliminary evaluation results. Finally, Section VI concludes with future research directions.
