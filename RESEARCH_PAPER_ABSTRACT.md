**Title:** An AI-Powered Cloud-Based Fitness Tracking System: Integrating Large Language Models for Personalized Workout Plan Generation

**Abstract:**

This paper presents FitnessTrack, a cloud-based fitness tracking platform that leverages Google's Gemini large language model to generate personalized workout and nutrition plans. The system employs a React frontend and Node.js/Express backend deployed on AWS Lambda with DynamoDB storage, utilizing prompt engineering to produce structured exercise regimens from user parameters including age, weight, height, fitness goals, and workout frequency. The platform features JWT authentication, real-time analytics, and an intelligent parsing system that extracts structured data from AI-generated text responses using regex-based pattern matching. Client-side state management through Redux with localStorage persistence enables session maintenance, while serverless architecture provides automatic scaling and cost-effectiveness. Implementation demonstrates the system's capability to generate contextually appropriate plans across diverse fitness objectives, addressing limitations of traditional one-size-fits-all applications and contributing to practical applications of generative AI in health and wellness domains.
